## Quiz Game in Python

This Python script is a simple quiz game that interacts with the user to ask questions and calculate their score. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The game starts with a welcome message and asks the player if they want to play.

2. If the player's response is not "yes" (case-insensitive), the game prints "Goodbye" and exits. Otherwise, it proceeds to the quiz.

3. The player is asked to enter their name.

4. A series of questions is asked, and the player's answers are checked for correctness. For each correct answer, the player's score increases by 1, and for each incorrect answer, the score decreases by 1.

5. The final score and the percentage of correct answers are displayed to the player.

This code provides a basic example of a text-based quiz game in Python. Feel free to modify and expand upon it to create your own custom quizzes!
